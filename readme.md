# Dobot Drawing Robot Setup Instructions

## Overview
This project uses a Dobot robotic arm to draw contours from images. Follow the steps below to set up and run the system properly.

## Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Download and install the Dobot libraries and other dependencies as specified in the code.

2. **Calibrate Pen Height**  
   Run the second script (`2.py`) to calibrate the pen height. This step ensures the pen touches the surface correctly.

3. **Prepare Drawing Images**  
   After successful calibration, download simple drawings with black outlines on a white background.

4. **Organize Images**  
   Create a new folder inside the project directory (e.g., `images/`) and place the downloaded drawings there.

5. **Run Drawing Script**  
   Launch the main drawing script (`1.py`).  
   **Important:** Monitor the robot during operation to prevent any potential damage.

## Notes
- Only use clear black-and-white images with well-defined contours.
- If any issue arises during execution, stop the robot immediately to avoid damage.
